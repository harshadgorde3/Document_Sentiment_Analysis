Squid Game Review: Netflix Global Hit Wants Condemn Violence While Reveling It To American viewers, "Squid Game" may seem emerged nowhere. But pretty unsurprising smash hit. The show, Netflix chief Ted Sarandos said track become Netfilx watched series ever, dominated charts world over, serving striking proof positive streamer's global strategy. And cheering quite many people curious project they're watching subtitles (or dubbed), little feels novel people flocking project allows ways. "Squid Game," created Hwang Donghyuk, depicts competition 456 entrants, boundless wealth made available whomever survives brutal gauntlet fatal events. These stages borrowed children's playground activities, lending certain simple irony brutal become: More half competitors gunned down, instance, first stage, version "Red Light, Green Light" move "Red Light" gunned down. This sees half competition — 200plus people — shot down, "Squid Game" hardly shy showing viscera. The violence eerily intimate impersonal: While there's brutal frankness way competitors' lives cut short, shooters masked game employees (or, case Red Light, Green Light, robotic doll). Death comes doled random functionaries, know significantly less game's players. What gradually learn, device detective who's broken system, utterly boughtin, obeying rules believing rigidly game they've worked present certain baroque innocence. This fact — gameplayers gamemakers bound need strange loyalty rhythms competition — clean, uncomplicated lines. It's structurally sound seems, glance, clever. So show's structure early going, surviving players allowed opportunity leave first bloodbath, end returning free need money badly. (Their situations represent legitimately interesting crosssection contemporary Korean culture, including North Korean defector migrant worker Pakistan.) Having seen harsh realities face game home, we're forced reckon notion infinitesimal odds survival Squid Game might better none modern society. But starting point series little way development. "Squid Game" amplifies endlessly, raising stakes level inhumanity. (Its opening salvo hundreds dead bodies seems difficult top, gets line demonstrations players' brutality, alternates somewhat schematically startling shows kindness.) Show creator Hwang Donghyuk emphasized wrote script series 2008, encountering recent projects similar plots, like "The Hunger Games" book film series. If we're comparing two, I'd argue "The Hunger Games" series clearly indicted audience, may final installment represented falloff popularity infrequently discussed today. No one wants told they're wrong enjoying enjoy. Indeed, piece art clearly brought mind significantly flattering 2019 film "Joker." There, here, violence depicted flatly, embellishment comes fussy trappings around death gore. Murder fetishized way raise stakes hazily political conversation without proposing solution. In "Joker" "Squid Game," concept economic equality floats thickly air killings start, "Squid Game's" broad crosssection modern Korean underclass ultimately explored avatars unluckiness unfairness characters. And cases, exactingly composed visual landscapes — respectively, 1970sScorsese homage playlandesque neons rustic imagery childhood — seem staged order disrupted death. (It's worth noting much "Squid Game's" nostalgic visual palette drawn specifically Korean culture, element white American critic lacks granular understanding.) As series runs on, becomes clear Squid Game exists many reasons, including harvesting human organs killed provide amusement chattering class wealthy people — depicted white Westerners — bet results. About first seems little say, impressive series found way even affectedly direct unbothered showing ways human body come apart. About second, seems insufficient irony even meaningful appreciation show encouraging audience much thing muchloathed spectators. One fellow, instance, shows Squid Game viewing party immediately starts threatening violating someone believes young functionary, culminating attempted coercive sex act. It's telling show feels need push hard insist people who'd watch Squid Game entertainment much morally degraded people who'd, say, simply watch "Squid Game" entertainment. Like "Joker," there's havingitbothways insistence culture could create violence inherently sick deranged, playing wildly overstated version sick derangement manner designed maximally tense amusing. To clear, obvious difference spectatorship realworld fictional violence, even Hwang's script dramatically draws out. But might easier see distinction pile bodies slaughtered service idea interesting inequality bad. A seasonclosing conversation game's winner architect indicates game was, essence, designed entertainment see possible people good. (He believes not, despite seen various participants exhibiting teamwork, selflessness, cooperation — then, personally betrayed game's winner, feelings may bit raw.) This feels painfully thin justification 455 dead bodies. Which maybe point: Those play Squid Game subject banal juvenile philosophizing who, lucky breaks life, get determine everyone else's reality. But taken literal terms, show burned much life much fake blood order stage characterbased investigation goodness, really surprise show taken off. In relishing fictional death, viewer series told he's something virtuous. And enjoying gruesomeness also tuttutting system would create gruesomeness rooting takedown, viewer experiencing double pleasure, sense enjoying show also perching ends complicated thing "Squid Game." In middle Netflix sensation Squid Game — people put lives line play children's games — discussion "the weakest link." Variously called "kachhimitti" North India "kachhalimboo" Western India, described "a beautiful rule kids used keep weakest kid feel like outcast." Squid Game, riveting Korean series written directed Hwang DongHyuk, makes room everyone play. Yet seems. I appreciate point letting less capable kids game, formally labelled weak — friends — millstone. Simple games rarely simple. This visually stunning series. Jackbooted thugs wear hot magenta jumpsuits. Stairways look like Super Mario versions MC Escher woodcuts. Primary geometric shapes — square, circle, triangle — everywhere, signifying code rank clue, shapes preschool Playstation. Then converge: triangle tables inside circle checkerboard floor squares. As memorably designed boardgame, aesthetic immediately demands attention. The premise deceptively simple: 456 people crushed insurmountable debt made compete winnertakesall series childhood games. If lose, killed. Lines influence drawn Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale, Hunger Games, Takashi Miike's As The Gods Will, even David Fincher's The Game. I also reminded funky Japanese Netflix series Alice In Borderland, Tokyo teenagers lasered eyes sky play games determined playing cards. It Squid Game, though, goes longform (over nine heavy episodes) really focuses drama individuals, active decision compete. They choose play. Away survivalist bustle game, one player pays get phone charged store another genuflect busfare. Inside threatening world, — nothing else — equal. Or they? Equality never absolute. In case means 455 456 die. This view cull. Squid Game centres around Seong Gihun (Lee Jungjae) compulsive gambler spent much life looking — betting — shortcuts he's barely moved forward. His mother needs operation, exwife moving countries daughter, signed away organs moneylenders literally suck blood. The first episode sets misery introducing gameshow mechanics series, remaining episodes compound it. He needs win. For ineptitude, Gihun essentially nice guy, something disadvantages arena uniquely suited sadists. His fellow participants less obviously sympathetic, unearth layers within each: Kang SaeByok (the stunning Jung Hoyeon) unrepentant pickpocket also defector North Korea wants bring family across border. O Yeungso shines old man brain tumor prefers play rather wait inevitable death real world. One compelling Gihun's brilliant friend, Cho Sangwoo (Park Haesoo), top student went high finance run investing recklessly Futures. Every story sob. This unashamedly melodramatic series — old people ailing, young wise beyond years — Hwang makes relevant present moment. Gihun's backstory involves labour strike statesponsored violence, violence glimpse astonishing reflection eyeball stays awake one night arena. Squid Game questions whether know games we're playing. Margaret Atwood coined term "Ustopia" denote hopeful (or seemingly hopeful) storyline dystopian world, Hwang's story set real world income inequality cursed medical aid, gives us weird kind hope. Participants play six games spread nine episodes, episodes hour long, left wanting more. Cutting tugofwar episode midtug cruel cliffhanger, I found sixth episode, "Gganbu," particularly jawdropping, expectations character dynamics entirely upended one elegant twist gameplay. For distinctive authenticity, Squid Game flounders dealing nonKoreans. A Pakistani character, Ali (Anupam Tripathi) naive point idiocy, exotically daft: reaction perfectly nondescript circle reminds "the moon hometown." Old wealthy Caucasian men — masked VIP guests watching macabre games — say nutty things cartoonish twang. When one says "Hell hath fury like woman scorned," another compelled add "Another student Bard, I idea." Then again, creating obnoxious caricatures rich white men may accidental. Or culpable. William Golding's enduring 1954 novel Lord Of The Flies featured shipwrecked schoolchildren trying, vain, govern descending savagery. It admittedly easy empathise participants but, subscribers funding megacorporation making series watched show world, aware irony. Those watching Squid Game stand sides wall. Here competing, hoping, flitting without point. Here watching, binging, amused realistic brutality. We lords. We flies. When everyone checked Netflix first time October, probably surprised Korean project titled "Squid Game" No. 1 show Trending tab. Out curiosity, lot people clicked "Play," one stop talking it. "Squid Game" taken country pace become Netfilx watched show ever. So Korean thriller adults playing playground games death become biggest show world? Regardless types shows normally watch, hard avoid discourse show either social media friends. "Squid Game" starts relatively tame; beginning greeted one protagonists, Gihun, middleaged man still lives mother. Gihun ideal child, mother leaves house, steals ATM card bet large sum money horse race. Gihun least 4 million Korean (3,382 USD) debt bad people needs millions gain back custody daughter provide sick mother. This desperation leads Gihun encounter man subway offering 50,000 wager beat quick game. Gihun loses over, without way pay, man allows Gihun wager slap face payment. After getting face bruised battered night, Gihun walks away winning big, man leaves, offers chance join contest win even greater, unimaginable sum money. While Gihun initially declines, decides can't pass opportunity chooses take part strange games man talking about. After arriving designated pickup spot, Gihun welcomed dimly lit car swiftly knocked sleeping gas notices unconscious people car When Gihun wakes, dressed unfamiliar green uniform, told sign waiver participate events come. The first game "Red Light, Green Light" contestants quickly realize fate hands gamemakers, less half contestants make game alive. Now Gihun must face friend foe test skills twisted games survive able walk away money. One biggest strengths show cast characters. In "Squid Game," Gihun reunites one old childhood friends form alliance others meet along way. There many unique personalities among contestants clash other, time work well together. The main protagonists show include Gihun old friend, Sangwoo, reunite games. Both characters completely contrast other, creating interesting dynamic develops throughout entire season. Sangwoo smalltown genius went one South Korea's prestigious universities, Gihun looked everyone crippling gambling addiction inability keep job. Sangwoo cold pragmatic strategist, Gihun friendly, charismatic Everyman. Every single character, whether protagonists villains, serves purpose, contribute eventual conclusion story. This story tackles many themes, none prevalent disparity rich poor. The games protagonists take part serve entertainment select elites around world. The participants forced fight kill one another, real enemies actually contestants; people put scenario. The story also deals many different perspectives grief contestant games takes death allies differently. Some brush off, carry wills fallen allies unable deal loss completely shut down. It makes stakes feel real every death immense emotional impact. There also degree social commentary piece South North Korean relations. There one character particular North Korean defector, treated coldly around her. There much story horror games. The controversial part show ending. Personally, I believe ending fell kind flat. There twists work well certain choices characters made make whole lot sense. The show definitely set solid sequel, I would preferred definitive ending rather cliffhanger. After success "Squid Game," likely Korean foreign shows hitting international mainstream future, something excited about. There much show new unique, still fails fully differentiate others battle royale death game genre. The characters atmosphere show make special. While ending may fall flat, everything completely new innovative, still much like definitely worth watch.
