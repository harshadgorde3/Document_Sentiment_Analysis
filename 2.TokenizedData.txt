{1: '\ufeffSquid Game Review: Netflix Global Hit Wants to Condemn Violence While Reveling in It\n\nTo American viewers, "Squid Game" may seem to have emerged from nowhere.', 2: 'But it is a pretty unsurprising smash hit.', 3: "The show, which Netflix chief Ted Sarandos has said is on track to become Netfilx most watched series ever, has dominated charts the world over, serving as striking proof positive of the streamer's global strategy.", 4: "And while it's cheering that quite so many people are curious about a project that they're watching with subtitles (or dubbed), little feels novel about people flocking to a project that allows them to have it both ways.", 5: '"Squid Game," created by Hwang Donghyuk, depicts a competition with some 456 entrants, in which boundless wealth is made available to whomever survives a brutal gauntlet of fatal events.', 6: 'These stages are borrowed from children\'s playground activities, lending a certain simple irony to just how brutal they become: More than half of the competitors are gunned down, for instance, in the first stage, a version of "Red Light, Green Light" in which those who move after "Red Light" are gunned down.', 7: 'This sees more than half the competition — some 200plus people — shot down, and "Squid Game" is hardly shy about showing viscera.', 8: "The violence is at once eerily intimate and impersonal: While there's a brutal frankness to the way the competitors' lives are cut short, the shooters are masked game employees (or, in the case of Red Light, Green Light, a robotic doll).", 9: "Death comes doled out by random functionaries, about whom we know significantly less than about the game's players.", 10: "What we gradually learn, through the device of a detective who's broken into the system, is that they are utterly boughtin, obeying rules of their own and believing rigidly in a game they've worked to present with a certain baroque innocence.", 11: 'This fact — that both gameplayers and gamemakers are bound by need and by a strange loyalty to the rhythms of the competition — has clean, uncomplicated lines.', 12: "It's structurally sound and seems, at a glance, clever.", 13: "So does the show's structure in its early going, as surviving players are allowed the opportunity to leave after the first bloodbath, and end up returning of their own free will because they need the money that badly.", 14: '(Their situations represent a legitimately interesting crosssection of contemporary Korean culture, including a North Korean defector and a migrant worker from Pakistan.)', 15: "Having now seen both the harsh realities they face in the game and at home, we're forced to reckon with the notion that infinitesimal odds of survival in the Squid Game might just be better than none in modern society.", 16: 'But this is a starting point from which the series does little in the way of development.', 17: '"Squid Game" amplifies itself endlessly, raising the stakes and the level of inhumanity.', 18: "(Its opening salvo of hundreds of dead bodies seems difficult to top, but it gets over the line in demonstrations of players' brutality, which alternates somewhat schematically with their startling shows of kindness.)", 19: 'Show creator Hwang Donghyuk has emphasized that he wrote the script for the series in 2008, before encountering recent projects with similar plots, like "The Hunger Games" book and film series.', 20: 'If we\'re comparing the two, I\'d argue that "The Hunger Games" series more clearly indicted the audience, which may be why its final installment represented a falloff in popularity and why it\'s infrequently discussed today.', 21: "No one wants to be told they're wrong for enjoying what they enjoy.", 22: 'Indeed, the piece of art this most clearly brought to mind was the significantly more flattering 2019 film "Joker."', 23: 'There, as here, violence is depicted flatly, and the embellishment comes from the fussy trappings around death and gore.', 24: 'Murder is fetishized as a way to raise the stakes in a hazily political conversation without proposing a solution.', 25: 'In both "Joker" and "Squid Game," the concept of economic equality floats thickly in the air before the killings start, with "Squid Game\'s" broad crosssection of the modern Korean underclass ultimately explored more as avatars of unluckiness or unfairness than as characters.', 26: 'And in both cases, exactingly composed visual landscapes — respectively, 1970sScorsese homage and playlandesque neons and rustic imagery of childhood — seem to have been staged in order to be disrupted by death.', 27: '(It\'s worth noting that much of "Squid Game\'s" nostalgic visual palette is drawn specifically from Korean culture, an element about which a white American critic lacks a granular understanding.)', 28: 'As the series runs on, it becomes clear that the Squid Game exists for many reasons, including for the harvesting of human organs from the killed and to provide amusement for a chattering class of wealthy people — some of them depicted as white Westerners — who bet on the results.', 29: "About the first there seems little to say, other than that it's impressive that the series found a way to be even more affectedly direct and unbothered about showing ways the human body can come apart.", 30: 'About the second, there seems insufficient irony or even meaningful appreciation that the show is encouraging its audience to do much the same thing as the muchloathed spectators.', 31: 'One fellow, for instance, shows up at the Squid Game viewing party and immediately starts threatening and violating someone who he believes to be a young functionary, culminating in an attempted coercive sex act.', 32: 'It\'s telling that the show feels the need to push this hard to insist that the people who\'d watch the Squid Game for entertainment are so much more morally degraded than people who\'d, say, simply watch "Squid Game" for entertainment.', 33: 'Like "Joker," there\'s a havingitbothways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing.', 34: "To be clear, there is an obvious difference between spectatorship of realworld and fictional violence, even before Hwang's script dramatically draws it out.", 35: 'But it might be easier to see that distinction if the pile of bodies had been slaughtered in service of an idea more interesting than that inequality is bad.', 36: "A seasonclosing conversation between the game's winner and its architect indicates that the game was, in its essence, designed for entertainment and to see if it is possible for people to be good.", 37: "(He believes that they are not, despite having seen various of the participants exhibiting teamwork, selflessness, and cooperation — but then, he was personally betrayed by the game's winner, so his feelings may be a bit raw.)", 38: 'This feels painfully thin as a justification for 455 dead bodies.', 39: "Which is maybe the point: Those who play the Squid Game are subject to the most banal and juvenile philosophizing of those who, because of lucky breaks in life, get to determine everyone else's reality.", 40: 'But taken on literal terms, that the show burned through so much life and so much fake blood in order to stage a characterbased investigation of goodness, then it really is no surprise that this show has taken off.', 41: "In relishing fictional death, the viewer of this series is told he's doing something virtuous.", 42: 'And in enjoying gruesomeness while also tuttutting at a system that would create such gruesomeness and rooting for its takedown, that viewer is experiencing a double pleasure, a sense of enjoying a show while also perching above it that ends up being the most complicated thing about "Squid Game."', 43: 'In the middle of Netflix sensation Squid Game — where people put their lives on the line to play children\'s games — there is a discussion about "the weakest link."', 44: 'Variously called "kachhimitti" in North India or "kachhalimboo" in Western India, this is described as "a beautiful rule kids used to keep so that the weakest kid wouldn\'t feel like an outcast."', 45: 'Squid Game, a riveting Korean series written and directed by Hwang DongHyuk, makes room for everyone to play.', 46: 'Yet all is not what it seems.', 47: 'I appreciate the point of letting less capable kids in on the game, but being formally labelled weak — by your friends — is its own millstone.', 48: 'Simple games are rarely simple.', 49: 'This is a visually stunning series.', 50: 'Jackbooted thugs wear hot magenta jumpsuits.', 51: 'Stairways look like Super Mario versions of MC Escher woodcuts.', 52: 'Primary geometric shapes — square, circle, triangle — are everywhere, signifying code and rank and clue, shapes that are both preschool and Playstation.', 53: 'Then they converge: there is a triangle of tables inside a circle on a checkerboard floor of squares.', 54: 'As with any memorably designed boardgame, the aesthetic immediately demands our attention.', 55: 'The premise is deceptively simple: 456 people crushed under insurmountable debt are made to compete in a winnertakesall series of childhood games.', 56: "If you lose, you're killed.", 57: "Lines of influence can be drawn from Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale, Hunger Games, Takashi Miike's As The Gods Will, and even David Fincher's The Game.", 58: 'I was also reminded of the funky Japanese Netflix series Alice In Borderland, where Tokyo teenagers are lasered down by eyes in the sky as they play games determined by playing cards.', 59: 'It is only Squid Game, though, that goes longform (over nine heavy episodes) and really focuses on the drama of the individuals, and on their active decision to compete.', 60: 'They choose to play.', 61: 'Away from the survivalist bustle of the game, one player pays to get his phone charged at a store while another has to genuflect for busfare.', 62: 'Inside that threatening world, they are — if nothing else — all equal.', 63: 'Or are they?', 64: 'Equality is never absolute.', 65: 'In this case it means 455 out of 456 will die.', 66: 'This is a view to a cull.', 67: "Squid Game centres around Seong Gihun (Lee Jungjae) a compulsive gambler who has spent so much of his life looking for — and betting on — shortcuts that he's barely moved forward.", 68: 'His mother needs an operation, his exwife is moving countries with his daughter, he has signed away organs to moneylenders who literally suck his blood.', 69: 'The first episode sets up his misery before introducing the gameshow mechanics of the series, and the remaining episodes compound it.', 70: 'He needs a win.', 71: 'For all his ineptitude, Gihun is essentially a nice guy, something that disadvantages him in an arena uniquely suited to sadists.', 72: 'His fellow participants are less obviously sympathetic, but we unearth layers within each: Kang SaeByok (the stunning Jung Hoyeon) is an unrepentant pickpocket but also a defector from North Korea who wants to bring her family across the border.', 73: 'O Yeungso shines as an old man with a brain tumor who prefers to play rather than wait for inevitable death in the real world.', 74: "One of the most compelling is Gihun's brilliant friend, Cho Sangwoo (Park Haesoo), a top student who went into high finance and is now on the run after investing recklessly in Futures.", 75: 'Every story has a sob.', 76: 'This is an unashamedly melodramatic series — the old people are ailing, the young are wise beyond their years — but Hwang makes it all relevant to our present moment.', 77: "Gihun's backstory involves a labour strike and statesponsored violence, violence we glimpse through an astonishing reflection in his eyeball as he stays awake one night in the arena.", 78: "Squid Game questions whether we know which games we're playing.", 79: 'Margaret Atwood coined the term "Ustopia" to denote a hopeful (or seemingly hopeful) storyline in a dystopian world, and while Hwang\'s story is set in the very real world of income inequality and cursed medical aid, it gives us a weird kind of hope.', 80: 'Participants play six games spread over nine episodes, and while most episodes are an hour long, they left me wanting more.', 81: 'Cutting off a tugofwar episode midtug is a cruel cliffhanger, but I found the sixth episode, "Gganbu," particularly jawdropping, where expectations and character dynamics are entirely upended with one elegant twist in gameplay.', 82: 'For all its distinctive authenticity, Squid Game flounders when dealing with nonKoreans.', 83: 'A Pakistani character, Ali (Anupam Tripathi) is not only naive to the point of idiocy, but exotically daft: his reaction to a perfectly nondescript circle is that it reminds him of "the moon in his hometown."', 84: 'Old wealthy Caucasian men — as masked VIP guests watching the macabre games — say nutty things with a cartoonish twang.', 85: 'When one says "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned," another is compelled to add "Another student of the Bard, I had no idea."', 86: 'Then again, creating obnoxious caricatures of rich white men may not be accidental.', 87: 'Or culpable.', 88: "William Golding's enduring 1954 novel Lord Of The Flies featured shipwrecked schoolchildren trying, in vain, to govern themselves before descending into savagery.", 89: 'It is admittedly easy to empathise with the participants but, as subscribers funding a megacorporation and making this series the most watched show in the world, we should be aware of the irony.', 90: 'Those watching Squid Game stand on both sides of the wall.', 91: 'Here we are competing, hoping, flitting about without a point.', 92: 'Here we are watching, binging, amused by realistic brutality.', 93: 'We are the lords.', 94: 'We are the flies.', 95: 'When everyone checked Netflix for the first time in October, they were all probably surprised when a Korean project titled "Squid Game" was the No.', 96: '1 show on the Trending tab.', 97: 'Out of curiosity, a lot of people clicked "Play," and now no one can stop talking about it.', 98: '"Squid Game" has taken over the country and is on pace to become Netfilx most watched show ever.', 99: 'So why has a Korean thriller about adults playing playground games to the death become the biggest show in the world?', 100: 'Regardless of the types of shows you normally watch, it has been hard to avoid the discourse about this show either on social media or with your friends.', 101: '"Squid Game" starts out relatively tame; from the beginning we are greeted by one of our protagonists, Gihun, a middleaged man who still lives with his mother.', 102: "Gihun isn't the ideal child, as once his mother leaves the house, he steals her ATM card to bet a large sum of her money on a horse race.", 103: 'Gihun is at least 4 million Korean won (3,382 USD) in debt to some bad people and needs millions more to gain back custody of his daughter and to provide for his sick mother.', 104: 'This desperation leads Gihun to an encounter with a man on the subway offering him a 50,000 won wager to beat him in a quick game.', 105: 'Gihun loses over and over, and without a way to pay, the man allows Gihun to wager a slap to the face as payment.', 106: 'After getting his face bruised and battered all night, Gihun walks away winning big, but before the man leaves, he offers him a chance to join a contest where he can win an even greater, unimaginable sum of money.', 107: "While Gihun initially declines, he decides he can't pass up the opportunity and chooses to take part in the strange games that man was talking about.", 108: 'After arriving at his designated pickup spot, Gihun is welcomed into a dimly lit car and is swiftly knocked out by sleeping gas just as he notices all the unconscious people in the car When Gihun wakes, he is dressed in an unfamiliar green uniform, and is told to sign a waiver before he can participate in the events to come.', 109: 'The first game is "Red Light, Green Light" and all the contestants quickly realize that their fate is in the hands of the gamemakers, as less than half of the contestants make it through that game alive.', 110: 'Now Gihun must face off against friend and foe to test his skills in these twisted games where only those who survive will be able to walk away with the money.', 111: 'One of the biggest strengths of this show is its cast of characters.', 112: 'In "Squid Game," Gihun reunites with one of his old childhood friends and they form an alliance with a few others they meet along the way.', 113: 'There are so many unique personalities among the contestants that clash with each other, but at the same time work well together.', 114: 'The main protagonists of the show include Gihun and his old friend, Sangwoo, who reunite in the games.', 115: 'Both of these characters completely contrast each other, creating an interesting dynamic that develops throughout the entire season.', 116: "Sangwoo is the smalltown genius who went to one of South Korea's most prestigious universities, while Gihun is looked down on by everyone because of his crippling gambling addiction and inability to keep a job.", 117: 'Sangwoo is a cold pragmatic strategist, while Gihun is more of the friendly, charismatic Everyman.', 118: 'Every single character, whether it be the protagonists or the villains, serves a purpose, and all contribute to the eventual conclusion to the story.', 119: 'This story tackles many themes, but none more prevalent than the disparity between the rich and the poor.', 120: 'The games our protagonists take part in serve as entertainment for a select few elites around the world.', 121: 'The participants are forced to fight and kill one another, but the real enemies are not actually the contestants; they are the people that put them into that scenario.', 122: 'The story also deals with many different perspectives of grief as each contestant in the games takes the death of their allies differently.', 123: 'Some brush it off, some carry on the wills of their fallen allies and some are unable to deal with their loss and completely shut down.', 124: 'It makes the stakes feel all the more real because every death has an immense emotional impact.', 125: 'There is also a degree of social commentary in this piece about South and North Korean relations.', 126: 'There is one character in particular who is a North Korean defector, and she is treated very coldly by some of those around her.', 127: 'There is much more to this story than just the horror of the games.', 128: 'The most controversial part about this show has to be the ending.', 129: 'Personally, I believe the ending fell kind of flat.', 130: "There were twists that did not work out that well and certain choices characters made that didn't make a whole lot of sense.", 131: 'The show is definitely set up for a solid sequel, but I would have preferred a more definitive ending rather than a cliffhanger.', 132: 'After the success of "Squid Game," there is likely to be more Korean or foreign shows hitting the international mainstream in the future, and that is something to be excited about.', 133: 'There is so much in this show that is new and unique, but it still fails to fully differentiate itself from others in the battle royale and death game genre.', 134: 'The characters and the atmosphere of this show are what make it special.', 135: 'While the ending may fall flat, and not everything is completely new and innovative, there is still much to like and it is definitely worth a watch.'}
